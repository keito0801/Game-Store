# Project1
Keith Gonzalez
This project is designed as a fictionous online game store.
This website is meant to be used as a game store featuring games for sale, offers on new discounts, and new games. A user can navigate to various pages using the navigation bar and view current games on sale.
This project uses html, a css stylesheet, javascript and bootstrap.
Ideas for future improvments on this project could be to...
1)add more variety of items for the user to explore 
2)add more clickable links and funtionality to the site
3)expand the site and offer more pages for the user to explore
